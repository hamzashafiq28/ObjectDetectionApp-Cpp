# ObjectDetectionApp-Cpp

This repository contains a project for creating a **Dynamic Link Library (DLL)** for object detection and a **C++ application** that utilizes the DLL for performing object detection tasks.

## Features

- **DLL Creation**: A reusable library for object detection functionality.
- **C++ Application**: A standalone application demonstrating the use of the DLL for object detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- **CMake**: For build configuration
- **OpenCV** (if used): Ensure the OpenCV library is installed for image processing tasks



## Example Workflow

- Build the DLL with the object detection functionality.
- Link the DLL with the application.
- Use the application to load images/videos for object detection via the DLL.

## Notes

- The DLL is designed to encapsulate all object detection logic, making it reusable across multiple applications.
- Ensure proper linking of libraries (e.g., OpenCV) when using the DLL.
